[Sindhuwadi][Sindhuwadi] started from humble beginings. It was a camp built by Sindhis who were forced to migrate from their homeland during the [India-Pakistan partition][partition] in the 1950s. Over the decades this humble colony evolved to become home to more than a hundred refugees, freedom fighters, and visionaries. 

For the next half a century, [Sindhuwadi][Sindhuwadi] trippled in size as the humble homes of the founders evolved into two-storied bunglows. Sindhuwadi became legally incorporated as 'The Fair Life Co-operative Housing Society'. The original residents found international success in business, medicine, engineering, and other noble professions. Some of them shifted to other parts of the world. This helped Sindhuwadi become a diverse, multi-cultural neighbourhood.

Today Sindhuwadi is home to many people of different faiths and beliefs. It is home to Sindhis, Gujaratis, Maharashtrians, and everyone is welcome to live in this peaceful neighbourhood.
